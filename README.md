## Welcome to Qresier â€“ The Ad-Free QR Code Generator!

In the digital age, QR Codes have become an essential tool for facilitating the exchange of information, links, and even contact information.

However, many free QR Code generator software come with invasive ads or limitations that always get in the way of having a good experience. I am frustrated and motivated to help more frustrated people have a decent and high-quality QR Code generator, without interruptions, offline or unwanted ads. The original project did not meet my needs
